The game uses two standard six-sided dice, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. The cup is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers on whether the sum total of numbers showing on the two dice will be "Ch≈ç" (even) or "Han" (odd). The dealer then removes the cup, displaying the dice. The winners collect their money. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8D-han)
